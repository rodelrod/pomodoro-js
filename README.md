Pomodoro-JS
===========

This is a pure (for now) javascript version of the pomodoro app I use for time-boxing.

The work has just started and it doesn't do anything but put up an ugly 25 minute countdown on a webpage.


Install
-------

Install the dependencies:

    npm install


Create the JS bundle:

    webpack -d


Open public/index.html in a browser and go crazy with the advanced functionality.
